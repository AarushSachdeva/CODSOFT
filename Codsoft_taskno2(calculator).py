#Make a simple calculator with basic arithmetic operations.Prompt the user to input two numbers and an operation choice.Perform the calculation and display the result.
a=int(input("Enter the first number:"))
b=int(input("Enter the second number:"))
choice=int(input("Enter the operation you want to perform\nPress 1 for sum\nPress 2 for subtraction\nPress 3 for multiplication\nPress 4 for division\nPress 5 for floor division\nPress 6 for exponential power\n"))
